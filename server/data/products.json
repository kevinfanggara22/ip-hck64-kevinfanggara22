        "description": "As intensity of exercise increases, the biological imbalance causes a build-up in blood lactate levels, which leads to muscle fatigue and impaired performance. Lactic acids contain a large amount of unused energy, which can be utilized by the aerobic system. KatsuoStamina helps to quickly convert lactic acid build-up in the body into energy. By using our product, you will dramatically decrease muscle trauma and muscle soreness, leading to quicker recovery times and an increase in performance levels. KatsuoStamina is the perfect supplement for marathons, cross-country running, swimming, rowing, skiing, mountaineering, triathlons, ball sports and other endurance-heavy activities.",
